My name is Sasuke Uchiha.
And I hate a lot of things. I particularly don't like anything.
And I want to destroy a certain someone.

These Sharingans can see through everything.
I can see through all your lies. Again and again and again!

Why do you keep following me? What am I to you?
For certainly I have turned into a MONSTER!

Don't even say Itachi's name. You cold blooded murderer.

Itachi devoted his life for the hidden leaf village. He thought like a Hokage when he was just 8 years old.
The leaders of the Leaf Village used him, used his powers to go against his own clan.
